      <p>
        Universe Trader welcomes you. Universe Trader provides its service to you subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you.
        In addition, when using particular Universe Trader owned or operated services, you and Universe Trader shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted
        from time to time. All such guidelines or rules  are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. Universe Trader may be referred as UT or universetrader.com in the following terms.
      </p>

      <ion-item>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</ion-item>
      <p>
        Universe Trader provides users with access to a rich collection of resources, including various communications tools, forums, search services, personalized content and branded programming through its
        network of properties which may be accessed through any various medium or device now known or hereafter developed (the "Service"). You also understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements
        and that these advertisements are necessary for Universe Trader to provide the Service. You also understand and agree that the Service may include certain communications from Universe Trader, such as
        service announcements, administrative messages and the Universe Trader Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of Universe Trader membership and you will not be able to opt out of
        receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Universe Trader properties, shall be subject to the TOS.
        You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that Universe Trader assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or
        personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service, and that access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are
        responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the
        Service.
      </p>

      <ion-item>Universe Trader PRIVACY POLICY</ion-item>
      <p>
        Universe Trader collects minimum data and information from you. Such can be your ip address and your hostname. To ensure we are publishing content customers need and want, Universe Trader collects
        aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. We do not track individuals' use of the site. When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer's machine (if the customer accepts cookies)
        or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the universetrader.com Web site, you will be able to view the text on the screens, however
        you will not experience a personalized visit nor will you be able to subscribe to the service offerings on the site.
      </p>

      <ion-item>USAGE FEES</ion-item>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise stated, the use of service offered is free of charge.
        The user may, however, purchase individual service offerings and individual features offered in the context of Universe Trader. The user is informed separately on the kind of features for purchase,
        especially what function each feature has, possibly of the duration of availability of the feature for purchase, the purchase price and the available payment method in connection with the game.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Where a minor wishes to buy features for purchase, he/she assures that he/she received the funds to buy the features for purchase from his/her legal guardian for this purpose or for unrestricted use.
        The agreed-upon charges are due for payment with the conclusion of the contract. The debit payment is made typically through the respective authorized service provider, whereby the withdrawal can be made
        a few days in advance to guarantee continuous usability. In individual cases, general terms and conditions included by the authorized service provider may be applicable.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        The user assures that all information provided in the context of a payment transaction (including bank, credit card number, etc.) is complete and correct.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        The payment options vary according to the participant country and the market availability of technically feasible payment options. Universe Trader reserves the right to amend its payment options.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Universe Trader reserves the right to change the fees of the in-game features (including virtual currencies). This includes Universe Trader`s right to increase or decrease fees for all singular in-game
        features for all future transactions.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        In case of default, statutory interest accrues. Universe Trader is also entitled to block the user account, to recover damages and to terminate services.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Should Universe Trader through a fault of the user (including an inadequate account balance) incur back charges or cancellation fees, the user shall bear the related costs. Universe Trader is allowed to
        request these costs and the accrued charges. Universe Trader is entitled to charge further compensation.
      </p>

            <li>
              We want to live up to your trust. You can contact us for any questions, suggestions or  complaints you may have regarding the way we handle your data in general, or with regards to this Privacy Policy
              in particular.

              A.1 Data  controller
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The data controller responsible for processing personal data is Web Craft House. We can be contacted for general enquiries regarding data protection at the address provided, by email at
                  ellenburgweb@gmail.com <!--or through our ticket support system at https://www.evdaimon.com/?a=ct-->

          </ul>

        <li>
          B. General information regarding data we process and how we collect it
          <ul>
            <li>
              B.1 Legal  basis for processing data
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We ensure from the moment of collecting your data that this is done in a reliable, transparent and appropriate manner. In judging whether we have the right to collect data, and how this data is to be
                  processed, we orientate ourselves on the requirements of applicable law, in particular on the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’), the Data Protection Act of the Hellenic
                  Republic and other legal provisions relating to the handling of personal data.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              B.2 Data  automatically collected by us
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When using Universe Trader services, system and user-related data is collected automatically and without any further action on the part of the user. For example, when you  visit Universe Trader web page,
                  the general specifications of your internet browser (e.g. type and version), time of access and the related IP address (an  individual address associated with your internet connection at this time),
                  as well as system configuration details (e.g. screen resolution and operating  system version) are collected and recorded in server logs. As a rule, this  information is not used to identify a specific
                  internet user.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the same  way, when you log into a Universe Trader account (e.g. when logging into a user  account for our forums, support or one of our online games), corresponding data  may be collected
                  automatically. You can find more information about this in  sections below.
                  <br>
                  This data  is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the business legitimate interests  (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of Universe Trader services, their
                  optimization, and for the registration, performance or  termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              B.3 Data generated by us
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the process of registering a Universe Trader account, and during its subsequent use, we generate data at different times and for different reasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This includes an individual username. This identification (e.g. account or character  IDs) serves the purpose of pseudonymization and is required for technical reasons, for example for logging into and
                  using a user account or for saving information concerning payment transactions separately. With regards to the data generated by us, this also includes data which may be recorded by our support team or
                  community management for the purposes of carrying out their tasks. Where there is suspicion that there has been a violation of our rules of  the game and Standard Terms of Use, this may include
                  checking and documenting the facts of the case and, if necessary, issuing warnings, but potentially also comments in favor of the user concerned, such as special authorizations permitted in
                  individual cases by the respective rules of the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company’s legitimate  interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of  Universe Trader services, their
                  optimization, and for the registration,  performance or termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article  6(1)(b)).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              B.4 Data provided by you
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The majority of the personal data we process is provided directly by our users.  Basic information is collected when registering a Universe Trader account  (generally your email address and chosen
                  pseudonym to identify your user account, your game characters and other game elements). As a rule, we do not collect any specific data such as the user’s name, date of birth or address.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The data provided by users also includes the content they have written (for example,  texts written in a forum or within the game or other messages sent to us by a  user).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Generally, the basic versions of online games offered by us can be used free of charge.  However, the user has the option to purchase additional content. For such  transactions, users therefore
                  provide us with information that is required by  us or our payment service providers in order to complete the payment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company’s legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of  Universe Trader services, their
                  optimisation, and for the registration, performance or termination of a user agreement (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              B.5 Data we collect from external sources
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In some  cases we receive personal data from third parties. This is primarily the case  when using a third-party login (for example, when logging into Universe Trader services via a Google
                  account). The data thus obtained shall be  limited to what is necessary for the login in question. However, the respective  third-party provider is responsible for the scope of the transmitted data.
                  We  therefore recommend that you read the data protection regulations of the  third-party provider carefully before using a corresponding login option.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the business’s legitimate  interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of  Universe Trader services, their
                  optimization, and for the registration,  performance or termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article  6(1)(b)).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              B.6  Voluntary provision and processing
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The provision of personal data and the associated use of Universe Trader services are entirely voluntary. The use of Universe Trader services, however, may require the provision and processing of
                  certain data for technical or contractual reasons. For the registration of a user account, for example, the provision of a valid email address is essential and in order to complete a payment
                  transaction, the necessary information must be provided.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For this  reason, failure to provide the necessary data may mean that we are unable to  provide certain services. Equally certain rights may be exercised in individual cases which mean that we are
                  unable to provide our services to the contractually agreed extent. Should this occur, we will inform the person in question of the consequences in each individual case.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          C. Special details regarding scope and purpose
          <ul>
            <li>
              In this section we explain comprehensively in which specific cases we process your data.
            </li>
            <li>
              The data is processed directly by Universe Trader within the territory of the United States. Should in individual cases personal data be processed by a different body, such as a company
              associated with us or a service provider, this will always proceed within the legal framework and on the basis of a contract with the respective third party which stipulates compliance with all
              relevant data protection regulations.
            </li>
            <li>
              C.1  Advertising on third-party sites and links to our website
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Like many other companies, we advertise our services on external websites. A typical  example are banner adverts, which are displayed on third-party websites as a graphic advertising one of the
                  online games we offer and linking to the corresponding Universe Trader web page via a hyperlink. Our partners do not  provide such advertisements free of charge. The success of the advertising
                  campaign is decisive in calculating the partner’s remuneration. In order to  determine this, an ID is generated when a user clicks on the advertisement. This ID is then allocated to the user’s account
                  when they subsequently register for a Universe Trader account. This enables us to determine the number of new users we have gained through the campaign in question. Finally, the advertising partner
                  receives a complete overview of these registrations from us and issues us an invoice based on these. In some cases, partners also receive remuneration in the event that a customer completes a payment
                  transaction. However, we do not pass on personal information about individual users to our advertising partners.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When  surfing external websites, the site operator may also set cookies (see C.6) or  create a device ID or a fingerprint (an individual value calculated from the  sum of different characteristics of
                  a user’s system) that enable the respective  provider to track the surfing behavior of its visitors. We therefore recommend  that you always read the data protection provisions of a page you visit
                  carefully.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Universe Trader has no interest in tracking the external surfing behavior of its users. However, we have a legitimate interest in finding out from which websites or through which advertising
                  campaigns our customers have found their way to us and which areas of Universe Trader’s services are of particular interest to users (see sections below).
                </li>
                <li>
                  This data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding our legitimate interests (GDPR  Article 6(1)(f)) in promoting Universe Trader services and the evaluation and billing of our advertising campaigns.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              C.2 Visiting our web pages without registering
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To the greatest possible extent, the Universe Trader web pages can be visited anonymously to gain information about our online games. Registering on the website is only necessary if you wish to use
                  functions that require a Universe Trader account. For example, participation in our games or forums is only possible once you register and log into your new Universe Trader account. Irrespective of
                  this, personal data may be collected and processed by us without registration in the following instances.
                </li>
                <li>
                  C.2.1  Server logs<br>
                  In using  Universe Trader services, server logs may be created which log certain connection  and usage activities.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      For example, page views, times of access, the registration of a user account and the IP address allocated to your internet connection are recorded for the purposes of identifying and preventing
                      cyberattacks or attempted manipulation, as well as for statistical analysis and the improvement of Universe Trader  services. Where necessary, other technical details such as the MAC address (the
                      network address of your network adapter) or similar identifying features may be recorded.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the smooth and secure operation of the Universe Trader services as well as  their optimization.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          D.Right to erasure
          <ul>
            <li>
              You have the basic right to demand the immediate deletion of your data. Legal reasons may however stand in the way of this, in particular the requirement to process the relevant data to fulfil the
              agreement with you or legal data retention requirements. In individual cases your data may also be required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. In such instances we will
              process the affected data strictly in accordance with this purpose, followed by immediate deletion as soon as the relevant reasons for retention no longer apply. We will inform you in such instances
              accordingly.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          E. Right to restriction of processing
          <ul>
            <li>
              As an alternative to the deletion of your data, you have the basic right to demand restrictions in how we process your data. If you make use of this right, we are essentially restricted to storing the
              associated data. Processing the data in other ways is only permissible with your consent, or for the purposes of establishing, exercising or defending legal claims, or to protect the rights of other
              natural persons or legal entities.
            </li>

              Unless otherwise stated, the use of service offered is free of charge.
              The user may, however, purchase individual service offerings and individual features offered in the context of Universe Trader. The user is informed separately on the kind of features for purchase,

              Where a minor wishes to buy features for purchase, he/she assures that he/she received the funds to buy the features for purchase from his/her legal guardian for this purpose or for unrestricted use.
              The agreed-upon charges are due for payment with the conclusion of the contract. The debit payment is made typically through the respective authorized service provider, whereby the withdrawal can be made
              a few days in advance to guarantee continuous usability. In individual cases, general terms and conditions included by the authorized service provider may be applicable.
            </ion-item>
            <ion-item>

            </ion-item>
            <ion-item>
              The payment options vary according to the participant country and the market availability of technically feasible payment options. Universe Trader reserves the right to amend its payment options.
            </ion-item>
            <ion-item>
              Universe Trader reserves the right to change the fees of the in-game features (including virtual currencies). This includes Universe Trader`s right to increase or decrease fees for all singular in-game
              features for all future transactions.
            </ion-item>
            <ion-item>
              In case of default, statutory interest accrues. Universe Trader is also entitled to block the user account, to recover damages and to terminate services.
            </ion-item>

              <ion-item>B. General  information regarding data we process and how we collect it</ion-item>
              <ion-item>
                In this section we inform you how we collect your data.
                <br>
                B.1 Legal  basis for processing data
                <br>
                We ensure from the moment of collecting your data that this is done in a reliable, transparent and appropriate manner. In judging whether we have the right to collect data, and how this data is to be
                processed, we orientate ourselves on the requirements of applicable law, in particular on the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’), the Data Protection Act of the Hellenic
                Republic and other legal provisions relating to the handling of personal data.
              </ion-item>
              <ion-item>
                B.2 Data  automatically collected by us
                <br>
                When using Universe Trader services, system and user-related data is collected automatically and without any further action on the part of the user. For example, when you  visit Universe Trader web page,
                the general specifications of your internet browser (e.g. type and version), time of access and the related IP address (an  individual address associated with your internet connection at this time),
                as well as system configuration details (e.g. screen resolution and operating  system version) are collected and recorded in server logs. As a rule, this  information is not used to identify a specific
                internet user.
              </ion-item>
              <ion-item>
                In the same  way, when you log into a Universe Trader account (e.g. when logging into a user  account for our forums, support or one of our online games), corresponding data  may be collected
                automatically. You can find more information about this in  sections below.
                <br>
                This data  is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the business legitimate interests  (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of Universe Trader services, their
                optimization, and for the registration, performance or  termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).
              </ion-item>
              <ion-item>
                B.3 Data generated by us<br>
                In the process of registering a Universe Trader account, and during its subsequent use, we generate data at different times and for different reasons.
                <br>
                This includes an individual username. This identification (e.g. account or character  IDs) serves the purpose of pseudonymization and is required for technical reasons, for example for logging into and
                using a user account or for saving information concerning payment transactions separately. With regards to the data generated by us, this also includes data which may be recorded by our support team or
                community management for the purposes of carrying out their tasks. Where there is suspicion that there has been a violation of our rules of  the game and Standard Terms of Use, this may include
                checking and documenting the facts of the case and, if necessary, issuing warnings, but potentially also comments in favor of the user concerned, such as special authorizations permitted in
                individual cases by the respective rules of the game.
              </ion-item>

              <ion-item>
                This data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company’s legitimate  interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of  Universe Trader services, their
                optimization, and for the registration,  performance or termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article  6(1)(b)).
              </ion-item>

              <ion-item>
                B.4 Data  provided by you
                <br>
                The majority of the personal data we process is provided directly by our users.  Basic information is collected when registering a Universe Trader account  (generally your email address and chosen
                pseudonym to identify your user account, your game characters and other game elements). As a rule, we do not collect any specific data such as the user’s name, date of birth or address.
                <br>
                The data provided by users also includes the content they have written (for example,  texts written in a forum or within the game or other messages sent to us by a  user).
                <br>
                Generally, the basic versions of online games offered by us can be used free of charge.  However, the user has the option to purchase additional content. For such  transactions, users therefore
                provide us with information that is required by  us or our payment service providers in order to complete the payment.

                This data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company’s legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of  Universe Trader services, their

                B.5 Data we collect from external sources
                <br>
                In some  cases we receive personal data from third parties. This is primarily the case  when using a third-party login (for example, when logging into Universe Trader services via a Google
                account). The data thus obtained shall be  limited to what is necessary for the login in question. However, the respective  third-party provider is responsible for the scope of the transmitted data.
                We  therefore recommend that you read the data protection regulations of the  third-party provider carefully before using a corresponding login option.

              <ion-item>
                B.6  Voluntary provision and processing
                <br>
                The provision of personal data and the associated use of Universe Trader services are entirely voluntary. The use of Universe Trader services, however, may require the provision and processing of
                certain data for technical or contractual reasons. For the registration of a user account, for example, the provision of a valid email address is essential and in order to complete a payment
                transaction, the necessary information must be provided.
              </ion-item>
              <ion-item>
                For this  reason, failure to provide the necessary data may mean that we are unable to  provide certain services. Equally certain rights may be exercised in individual cases which mean that we are
                unable to provide our services to the contractually agreed extent. Should this occur, we will inform the person in question of the consequences in each individual case.
              </ion-item>

              <ion-item>
                C. Special details regarding scope and purpose
                <br>
                In this section we explain comprehensively in which specific cases we process your data.
                <br>
                The data is processed directly by Universe Trader within the territory of the United States. Should in individual cases personal data be processed by a different body, such as a company
                associated with us or a service provider, this will always proceed within the legal framework and on the basis of a contract with the respective third party which stipulates compliance with all
                relevant data protection regulations.
              </ion-item>

              <ion-item>
                C.1  Advertising on third-party sites and links to our website
                <br>
                Like many other companies, we advertise our services on external websites. A typical  example are banner adverts, which are displayed on third-party websites as a graphic advertising one of the
                online games we offer and linking to the corresponding Universe Trader web page via a hyperlink. Our partners do not  provide such advertisements free of charge. The success of the advertising
                campaign is decisive in calculating the partner’s remuneration. In order to  determine this, an ID is generated when a user clicks on the advertisement. This ID is then allocated to the user’s account
                when they subsequently register for a Universe Trader account. This enables us to determine the number of new users we have gained through the campaign in question. Finally, the advertising partner
                receives a complete overview of these registrations from us and issues us an invoice based on these. In some cases, partners also receive remuneration in the event that a customer completes a payment
                transaction. However, we do not pass on personal information about individual users to our advertising partners.
              </ion-item>
              <ion-item>
                When  surfing external websites, the site operator may also set cookies (see C.6) or  create a device ID or a fingerprint (an individual value calculated from the  sum of different characteristics of
                a user’s system) that enable the respective  provider to track the surfing behavior of its visitors. We therefore recommend  that you always read the data protection provisions of a page you visit
                carefully.
              </ion-item>
              <ion-item>
                Universe Trader has no interest in tracking the external surfing behavior of its users. However, we have a legitimate interest in finding out from which websites or through which advertising
                campaigns our customers have found their way to us and which areas of Universe Trader’s services are of particular interest to users (see sections below).
              </ion-item>
              <ion-item>
                This data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding our legitimate interests (GDPR  Article 6(1)(f)) in promoting Universe Trader services and the evaluation and billing of our advertising campaigns.
              </ion-item>

              <ion-item>
                C.2  Visiting our web pages without registering
                <br>
                To the greatest possible extent, the Universe Trader web pages can be visited anonymously to gain information about our online games. Registering on the website is only necessary if you wish to use
                functions that require a Universe Trader account. For example, participation in our games or forums is only possible once you register and log into your new Universe Trader account. Irrespective of
                this, personal data may be collected and processed by us without registration in the following instances.
              </ion-item>

              <ion-item>
                C.2.1  Server logs<br>
                In using  Universe Trader services, server logs may be created which log certain connection  and usage activities.
              </ion-item>
              <ion-item>
                For example, page views, times of access, the registration of a user account and the IP address allocated to your internet connection are recorded for the purposes of identifying and preventing
                cyberattacks or attempted manipulation, as well as for statistical analysis and the improvement of Universe Trader  services. Where necessary, other technical details such as the MAC address (the
                network address of your network adapter) or similar identifying features may be recorded.
              </ion-item>
              <ion-item>
                This data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the smooth and secure operation of the Universe Trader services as well as  their optimization.
              </ion-item>

              <ion-item>
                D.Right to erasure
                <br>
                You have the basic right to demand the immediate deletion of your data. Legal reasons may however stand in the way of this, in particular the requirement to process the relevant data to fulfil the
                agreement with you or legal data retention requirements. In individual cases your data may also be required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. In such instances we will
                process the affected data strictly in accordance with this purpose, followed by immediate deletion as soon as the relevant reasons for retention no longer apply. We will inform you in such instances
                accordingly.
              </ion-item>

              <ion-item>
                E. Right to restriction of processing
                <br>
                As an alternative to the deletion of your data, you have the basic right to demand restrictions in how we process your data. If you make use of this right, we are essentially restricted to storing the
                associated data. Processing the data in other ways is only permissible with your consent, or for the purposes of establishing, exercising or defending legal claims, or to protect the rights of other
                natural persons or legal entities.
